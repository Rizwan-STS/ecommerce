                    other items en route to their destination. We are a convenience store on the go, that gives
                    qualified ride-sharing drivers the ability to sell items by providing them with free boxes filled
                    with the kinds of goods you might find in a convenience store, including snacks, beauty products and
                    phone chargers.</p>

                <p class="padding-15px-tb text-small">Riders can use Ridekaartâ€™s mobile web menu on their smartphones
                    (without downloading an app) to buy what they need.</p>
